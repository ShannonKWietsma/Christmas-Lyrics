Happy Holiday
Happy Holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
Happy Holiday to you

It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus is coming round
The Christmas snow is white on the ground
When old Santa gets into town
He'll be coming down the chimney, down

It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus has got a toy
For every good girl and good little boy
Santa's a great big bundle o' joy
When he's coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
So hoop-de-do and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
So hoop-de-do and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney, down

Happy Holiday
Happy Holiday
While the merry bells keep bringing
Happy Holiday to you
