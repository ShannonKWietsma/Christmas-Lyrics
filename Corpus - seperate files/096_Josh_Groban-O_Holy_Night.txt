O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, a weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, O hear the Angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine!

Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His Holy name

Christ is the Lord, let ever, ever praise we
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!
