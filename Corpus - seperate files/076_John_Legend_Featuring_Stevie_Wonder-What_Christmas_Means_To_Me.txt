Oh yeah
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
(All these things and more, my baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

Oh yeah
And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I've never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And the little thoughts she'd give me
Touch my heart for sure

Oh, all these things and more
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

Oh yeah
I feel like runnin' wild
I feel just like a little child
Bring you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once and then some more
Wish you a merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year, oh
(Happiness in the coming year)

Let's deck the halls with holly
Singing "Silent Night"
Dress the trees with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

Oh, all these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, yeah
