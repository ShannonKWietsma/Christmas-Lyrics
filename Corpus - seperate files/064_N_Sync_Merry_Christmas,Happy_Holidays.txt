Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays

We've been waiting all year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive

And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time
And all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here

And with the blessings from above
God sends you His love
And everybody's OK
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Bells are ringing
It's time to scream and shout (scream and shout)
And everybody's playing 'cause school's out
Celebrating this special time we share
Happiness 'cause love is in the air

And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time
And all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here

And with the blessings from above
God sends you His love
And everything's OK
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

No matter what your holiday
It's a time to celebrate
And put your worries aside (worries aside)
And open up your mind (open up your mind)
See the world right by your side
It's Christmas time

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays
Sing it everybody

Come on now
Merry Christmas,

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
