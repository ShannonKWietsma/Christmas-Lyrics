Do you hear what I hear
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?"
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?"

A song, a song, high above the tree
With a voice as a big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Now said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
"Do you know what I know?"
"Do you know what I know?"
In your palace, warm, mighty king (mighty king, do you know)
"Do you know what I know?"

A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold (silver and gold)

Said the king (said the king), to the people everywhere (everywhere)
Oh yeah
Listen to what I say (listen to what I say)
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say (listen to what I say)
A child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
