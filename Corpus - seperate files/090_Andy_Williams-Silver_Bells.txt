Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights, even stoplights blink of bright red and green
(Silver bells, silver bells)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(It's Christmas time in the city)

Children laughing, people passing meeting smile after smile
(Ring-a-ling, hear them ring)
And above all this bustle you'll hear
(Soon it will be Christmas day)

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)
