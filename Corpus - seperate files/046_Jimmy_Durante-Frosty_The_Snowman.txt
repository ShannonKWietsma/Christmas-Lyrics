Come a little closer children, I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of, and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy, you didn't finish your story.)
I know, I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble, you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Over the hills of snow
