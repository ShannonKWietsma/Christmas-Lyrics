Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings

Brings...

This night
We pray
Our lives
Will show
This dream
He had
Each child
Still knows

We are waiting
We have not forgotten

On this night
On this night
On this very Christmas night
