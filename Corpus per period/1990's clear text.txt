I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby



Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings
The joy that he brings

Brings...

This night
We pray
Our lives

This dream

Each child
Still knows

We are waiting
We have not forgotten

On this night
On this night
On this very Christmas night

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays

We've been waiting all year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive

And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time
And all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here

And with the blessings from above
God sends you His love
And everybody's OK
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Bells are ringing
It's time to scream and shout (scream and shout)
And everybody's playing 'cause school's out
Celebrating this special time we share
Happiness 'cause love is in the air

And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time
And all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here

And with the blessings from above
God sends you His love
And everything's OK
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

No matter what your holiday
It's a time to celebrate
And put your worries aside (worries aside)
And open up your mind (open up your mind)
See the world right by your side
It's Christmas time

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays
Sing it everybody
Merry Christmas,
Come on now
Merry Christmas,
Let me hear it
Merry Christmas
And Happy Holidays

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling

Don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
Don't care about those presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl, what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No, I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...
