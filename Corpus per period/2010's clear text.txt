Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't here
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

Sure it's Christmas once more...

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryna play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
Let It Snow is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be here!
(Santa tell me)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa tell me)
(If you're really there)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Tell me babe)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Tell me)
(Tell me baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Do you care)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here (He won't be here next year)
Next year
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you.

Mary, did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy will calm the storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby, you kiss the face of God.

Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know?..
Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know?..

The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again.
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb!

Mary, did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
That sleeping child you're holding is the great I am.

Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know? Mary, did you know?..
Mary, did you know?

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Ayy, love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Ayy, love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing: your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe, yeah

With you, shawty with you

Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

And then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath my tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath my tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight

Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree

Elsa?

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away

We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!

Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman...

Go away, Anna.

Okay, bye...

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls!

(Hang in there, Joan.)

It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by...
(Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock)

Elsa, please I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "Have courage, " and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in

We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?

Do you wanna build a snowman?
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I gotta go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fire place roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat (well, thank you), your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

(You're very pushy, you know)
(I'd like to think of it as opportunistic)

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is "No"
But, baby, it's cold outside
(come on)
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
(and I don't even smoke)
Never such a blizzard before

I gotta get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I feel when I touch your hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold-out
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

(OK, fine, just another drink then
Well, that took a lot of convincing)
(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
Not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
Oh if there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas)
Oh but it's Christmas day
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
Oh comin' home
Oh babe
You know I need you
Oh comin' home

(Love, love, love, love)
I gotta have you
(Love, love, love, love)
You know I need you
(Love, love, love, love)
Oh love, oh love
(Christmas)
Woohoo...

(Love, love, love, love)
I gotta have you
(Love, love, love, love)
I said nanananana...
It's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas... yeah
Yeah... Lalalalala...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow

Said I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
[Shania Twain:]
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Dum-dum-dum-dum

There's snow on the ground, love in the air, sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about, the fire is warm, the angels are singin'

And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year

You make every day feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

Look at the lights, twinklin' bright twenty-four/seven
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white, this could be heaven

And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year, yeah (Woo)

You make every day feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas), never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Every day that I'm with you)
Every day, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

You make every day feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wish list, right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

Hey, hey, yeah, every day, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beatin', you better believe
You make every day feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Every day that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Every day that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Every day that I'm with you

Oh yeah
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
(All these things and more, my baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

Oh yeah
And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I've never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And the little thoughts she'd give me
Touch my heart for sure

Oh, all these things and more
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

Oh yeah
I feel like runnin' wild
I feel just like a little child
Bring you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once and then some more
Wish you a merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year, oh
(Happiness in the coming year)

Let's deck the halls with holly
Singing "Silent Night"
Dress the trees with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

Oh, all these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, yeah

The fireplace is burning bright, shining all on me
I see the presents underneath the good old Christmas tree
And I wait all night 'til Santa comes to wake me from my dreams
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

I see the children play outside, like angels in the snow
While mom and daddy share a kiss under the mistletoe
And we'll cherish all these simple things wherever we may be
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

I've got this Christmas song in my heart
I've got the candles glowing in the dark
I'm hanging all the stockings by the Christmas tree
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

I listen for the thud of reindeer walking on the roof
As I fall asleep to lullabies, the morning's coming soon
The only gift I'll ever need is the joy of family
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

I've got this Christmas song in my heart (song in my heart)
I've got the candles glowing in the dark
I'm hanging all the stockings by the Christmas tree
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

Oh
Oh

Oh, all the joy that fills our hearts and makes us see
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me

I've got this Christmas song in my heart
I've got the candles glowing in the dark
And then for years to come we'll always know one thing
That's the love that Christmas can bring
Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catching up with folks we barely know
Sure it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (take the day off)
Get a massage (get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (a little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (ooh)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (we ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (mhm)
And warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('cause you're the blessin')
Yes, you're the only one I'm wishing for

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?

No, no, no, no
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (no oh oh oh oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
Your troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
Your troubles will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together,
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.

So have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We're gonna be a classic for all time
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along; I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oh-oh
Thank you baby)

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have some snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

Do you hear what I hear
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?"
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?"

A song, a song, high above the tree
With a voice as a big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Now said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
"Do you know what I know?"
"Do you know what I know?"
In your palace, warm, mighty king (mighty king, do you know)
"Do you know what I know?"

A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold (silver and gold)

Said the king (said the king), to the people everywhere (everywhere)
Oh yeah
Listen to what I say (listen to what I say)
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say (listen to what I say)
A child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod
When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

Oh, Mary, did you know
Mary, did you know, ooh

Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Ooh, Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect lamb
And the sleeping child you're holding
He is the great, the great I Am?

Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, a weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, O hear the Angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine!

Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His Holy name

Christ is the Lord, let ever, ever praise we
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!
Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine!

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
The beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married? We'll say: No man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kid is knockin' him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry be happy now

Don't worry
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Don't worry, 'cause we're walking in a winter wonderland
Merry Christmas, ladies
Merry Christmas, Mr. Buble
Are you ready to sing a little Jingle Bells?
Yeeeees

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what a lotta fun, what a lotta fun to ride and sing
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)
In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh)
O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go, we go)
Laughing all the way (all the way)
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun in one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way)
I was following the [8x]

I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads
From fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall
And turn the white snow red as strawberries
In the summertime
