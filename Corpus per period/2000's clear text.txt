Where are you, Christmas?
Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me?
Why can't I hear music play?
My world is changing
I'm re-arranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too?

Where are you, Christmas?
Do you remember
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go?

Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you, Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love

Where are you, Christmas?
Fill your heart with love
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock

Do you hear what I hear?
(Hear what I hear, hear what I hear?)
Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see? (do you see what I see?)
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see? (do you see what I see?)
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? (Do you hear what I hear?)
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? (Do you hear what I hear?)
A song, a song high above the tree
With a voice as big as the the sea
With a voice as big as the the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king

Do you know what I know? (what I know, what I know?)
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know? (what I know, what I know?)
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say! (what I say, what I say)
Pray for peace, people, everywhere
Listen to what I say! (what I say, what I say)
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights, even stoplights blink of bright red and green
(Silver bells, silver bells)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(It's Christmas time in the city)

Children laughing, people passing meeting smile after smile
(Ring-a-ling, hear them ring)
And above all this bustle you'll hear
(Soon it will be Christmas day)

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)

It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
And standing right in front of me was a
Little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing around like little boys do
And in his hands he held
A pair of shoes

His clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

Sir I wanna buy these shoes
For my mama. please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir
Daddy says there's not much time
You see,
She's been sick for quite a while And I
know these shoes will make her smile And I
Want her to look beautiful
If mama meets Jesus tonight

They counted penny's for what seemed like years then the
Cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here."
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me and he said
"Mama made Christmas good at our house though
Most years she just did without, Tell me sir,
What am I gonna do?
Some how I gotta buy her these Christmas shoes."

So I laid the money down
I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said,
"Mama's gonna look so great."


I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love as he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent me that little boy to remind me what Christmas is all about

I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright, whoa-oh-oh
We're caroling through the night, whoa-oh-oh
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Whoa-oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh
Ha, let's go (Woo!)

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah, huh, whoa-oh-oh
Oh, ha ha, shake a hand, shake a hand now
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Ooh, the fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me, yes, it will be
Whoa-oh-oh, ha
Shake a hand now
Come on, everybody shake a hand now, ha
Family, hey
We'll be together
To make this Christmas bright, yes, we will
